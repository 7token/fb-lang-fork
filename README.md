# fb-lang
a esoteric, brainfuck inspired language written in lua.

to get started, install lua. then, make a new file in the fb-lang directory with a .fb extension. then, open your terminal and navigate to the fb-lang directory.
run fb-tool.lua from your command line, and then type "fb run". then, just type the name of your program, and it works. cool. nice. awesome.
