Here's some basic docs.
    
    1. HOW IT WORKS
        Fb uses symbols to represent a tape. This tape is filled with cells, which you can increment and decrement to your liking.

        Use > to move to the next cell, and < to move back.
        Use ^ to increase the current cell's value, and use v to decrease the current cell's value.
        You can use curly brackets 
        {to specify a for loop. the number of repeats is defined by the value of the current cell. an ending bracket to a loop must be followed by a semicolon};
            Don't nest For loops, dumbass.
        Use ! to print the entire contents of the tape. Useful for debugging.
        Use ; to print the value of the current cell.
        Use # to print the value of the current cell, converted into letters. (1-26=lowercase alphabet, 27=space, 28=exclamation point)

        Additionally, you can use "D" to enable a debug mode that will print exactly what is currently happening.

    2. RUNNING CODE
        to run code, enter your terminal. navigate to the folder with the Fb.lua file in it, and run "lua Fb.lua". 
        You will then be prompted to enter your script (must be one line), and then it will ask you how long the tape is. 
        If no tape length is specified, it defaults to 100.


Conditional Examples Maybe:
>^^?
 - logs that cell to be conditionalizionied
 >>^^^?
 - logs that cell to be the secondary conditional cell
 =)
 - compares the two cells, if they are the same, then it runs the code within the = and the ). 
    - if the statement is not true, then it just skips ahead until the parenthesis.

CONDITIONAL EXAMPLE:
^^^?>^^^?=!)
returns with a pushtape!

^^^?>^^^^>^^^>^^>^^^^^<?=!)

USER INPUT:
asks for user input in the form of a number. if the number is equal to the defined conditional, then it will run the code within the parenthsesesised. else, it skips to the end of the aprenthesis.

^^^?>$!)
