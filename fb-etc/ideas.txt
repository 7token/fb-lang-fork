- commandline system so you dont have to restat the lua program every time you want to run a program (FINISHED ! IT WAS VERY SIMPLE!)
- reading files so we can write fb files (ALSO DONE!)
- pizza
- currently used symbols:
  - !
  - #
  - <>
  - ^
  - v
  - ?
  - $
  - )

- functions? could very well be a good idea. also could be hellish.
  - basically, you could designate a cell as a function, and then go back to that cell to call it?
  - idk seems really tough to do though
